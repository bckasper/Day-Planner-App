# Day-Planner-App
This is a simple application that allows the user to plan out a single work day (using standard 9AM - 5PM hours). Below, you will find instructions for how this application works, links to the live URL and GitHub repo, as well as a screenshot of the application. 



## How does this application work?
**Below is a detailed breakdown of how this application works:**

1. The user opens the application using the Live URL link below.

2. The user will see a Jumbotron header at the top that displays the app's title, a short description, the current day and date, and a button to clear the planner.

3. When the user scrolls down, they will see 9 time blocks representing one hour each for the hours of 9AM to 5PM (a standard work day). Each time block will be a single row split into three sections:
    - First, on the left the user will see the hour of that time block (e.g., 9AM)
    - Second, in the center the user will see an input section where they can enter what they plan to do in that timeblock
    - Third, on the right the user will see a save button

4. The time blocks will be color coded to represent the past, present, and future. These colors will dynamically update as time progresses throughout the day. The color codes are:
    - Grey represents the past
    - Green represents the present
    - Blue represents the future

5. The user will navigate to the time block they desire, enter the details of what they plan to do in that time block, and click the save button on the right

6. If the user refreshes, they will see that any item they saved will remain in place. If the user wants to change their planner's content, they can do one of two things:
    - The user can type over the current content, then hit save and the updated content will be stored in that time block
    - The user can also choose to click "Clear Scheduler" button, which will clear the local storage and thus refresh the entire planner
